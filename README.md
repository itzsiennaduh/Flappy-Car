## This project was originally for a course at the University of Canterbury, but I am continuing to develop it even after submission. 

## Authors
- Sienna Robinson
- Siegfried Weigler-Harding

## Prerequisites
- JDK >= 21 [click here to get the latest stable OpenJDK release (as of writing this README)](https://jdk.java.net/21/)
- *(optional)* Gradle [Download](https://gradle.org/releases/) and [Install](https://gradle.org/install/)


## What's Included
This project utilises:
- JavaFX
- Junit 5

## Importing Project (Using IntelliJ)
IntelliJ has built-in support for Gradle. To import your project:

- Launch IntelliJ and choose `Open` from the start-up window.
- Select the project and click open
- At this point in the bottom right notifications you may be prompted to 'load gradle scripts', If so, click load

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Gradle pop up doesn't appear then open the Gradle sidebar and click the Refresh icon.*

## Run Project 
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `./gradlew clean run` to run the app.
2. The app should then open a new window, this may not be displayed over IntelliJ but can be easily selected from the taskbar

## Build and Run Jar
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `./gradlew jar` to create a packaged Jar. The Jar file is located at build/libs/seng201_team124-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
2. Navigate to the build/libs/ directory (you can do this with `cd build/libs`)
3. Run the command `java -jar seng201_team124-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to open the application.

## Run Tests
1. Open a command line interface inside the project directory and run `./gradlew test` to run the tests.
2. Test results should be printed to the command line

**Note:** *This Jar is **NOT** cross-platform, so you **must** build the jar you submit on Linux.*
